# Literature Review: Advanced Prompt Engineering\n\n The literature on Advanced Prompt Engineering focuses primarily on optimizing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and its applicability to various tasks. Notably, [Benchmarking Prompt Engineering Techniques for Secure Code Generation with GPT Models] highlights the significance of prompt engineering in enhancing secure code generation using LLMs such as GPT-4o. This research proposes a "Prompt Agent" approach to systematically improve prompts and incorporate iterative refinement techniques, aiming to boost the security of generated code [Benchmarking Prompt Engineering Techniques for Secure Code Generation with GPT Models].

On the other hand, [Towards Goal-oriented Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models A Survey] emphasizes the need to address the limitations in designing prompts based on an anthropomorphic assumption. The authors demonstrate that a goal-oriented prompt formulation significantly improves the performance of LLMs by guiding them to follow established human logical thinking. They also introduce a taxonomy that categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages [Towards Goal-oriented Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models A Survey].

The review reveals a common understanding that appropriate prompt engineering is crucial for LLMs to perform optimally and, in some cases, such as secure code generation, to improve security. However, the potential of prompt engineering to influence the security of generated code remains under-studied [Benchmarking Prompt Engineering Techniques for Secure Code Generation with GPT Models]. Future research could focus on expanding upon these findings and investigating how various prompt engineering techniques impact the security of code generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, goal-oriented prompt engineering has the potential for broader applications beyond the tasks summarized in existing literature [Towards Goal-oriented Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models A Survey].
