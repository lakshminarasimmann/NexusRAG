 Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a significant area of research, with a focus on extracting information from text data [1]. The past two decades have witnessed the increasing prominence of machine learning algorithms in clinical NLP research [2]. This is evident in studies such as Kumar et al. (2016), who developed dynamic memory networks for NLP, and Kushman and Barzilay (2013a) who used semantic unification to generate regular expressions from natural language text.

In the context of Java code generation from natural language text, several state-of-the-art methods have been proposed. Reed and de Freitas (2016) introduced neural programmer-interpreters, while Rozière et al. (2020) presented an unsupervised translation of programming languages. Schwenk and Bengio (2014a, 2014b) utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) encoder–decoder for statistical machine translation, which is a crucial component in the process of code generation [3].

The literature emphasizes that code generation is an important NLP task [4]. It has been observed that initializing models from pre-trained weights often yields better results than training them from scratch [4]. Moreover, decoder-only models are found to excel in comprehending the syntax and semantics of code [4]. Combining multiple learning objectives is also suggested as a strategy to enhance the performance of code generation models [4]. Improving code generation metrics has become crucial for comparing and further improving state-of-the-art methods [4].

In summary, NLP research has made substantial progress in various domains including clinical research and Java code generation. Machine learning algorithms have played a significant role in this advancement. The focus on improving code generation metrics indicates the continued importance of this task in NLP research.
