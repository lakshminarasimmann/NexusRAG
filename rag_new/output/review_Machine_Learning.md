 Machine Learning, a subdiscipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has emerged as a transformative tool in various fields, including statistics and biology [1-4]. The core principle of machine learning involves building algorithms that automatically learn from data to identify patterns, relationships, and structures that may be difficult or impossible for humans to discern [Changing Data Sources, 2020]. This approach enables machines to improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed [Changing Data Sources, 2020].

In the context of official statistics, machine learning can complement or even replace traditional methods [Changing Data Sources, 2020]. Its ability to nowcast and forecast is particularly valuable, providing more up-to-date and precise estimates of economic and social trends [Changing Data Sources, 2020]. Machine learning algorithms can analyze data from a wide range of sources, allowing statistical agencies to gain a more nuanced understanding of trends and patterns [Changing Data Sources, 2020].

Deep learning, a subdiscipline of machine learning, is also mentioned in the context of changing data sources [Changing Data Sources, 2020]. However, details on its specific applications in official statistics are not provided.

In the field of biology, machine learning is increasingly used to provide predictions and improve decision processes [DOME Recommendations, 2019]. To establish standards of supervised machine learning validation in biology, a set of community-wide recommendations has been proposed, advocating for a structured methods description called DOME (data, optimization, model, evaluation) [DOME Recommendations, 2019].

In synthesis, the literature demonstrates that machine learning is a powerful tool with vast potential across various disciplines. The approach enables machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and improve performance over time. In official statistics, it can provide more timely, accurate, and comprehensive insights into societal topics. In biology, it's used for predictions and decision-making processes, with recommendations proposed to standardize its validation.
