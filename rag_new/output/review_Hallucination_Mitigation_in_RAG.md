# Hallucination Mitigation in RAG

**Strategy Used:** Standard
**Quality Score:** 4.5/5

 The literature on Hallucination Mitigation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention due to its impact on enhancing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This section focuses on the role of RAG in mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations [1].

Two primary application categories of RAG are identified: precise retrieval and broad retrieval. Key techniques from different perspectives have been systematically analyzed, enabling hallucination mitigation methods to adapt better to various application domains [1]. Notably, among various strategies, RAG and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two highly effective and widely adopted approaches for reducing hallucinations in LLMs [2].

A comprehensive taxonomy of hallucination types has been proposed that specifically arises from the interaction between the retriever and the generator in RAG systems [3]. A unified pipeline for attribution-based hallucination mitigation consisting of four modular components—Query Refining (T1), Reference Identification (T2), Prompt Engineering (T3), and Response Correction (T4)—has been introduced. Each module is mapped to the hallucination types they best mitigate, offering practical guidance on selecting appropriate techniques based on the source of error [3].

The literature establishes a taxonomy that distinguishes knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations [2]. It is observed that RAG, reasoning augmentation, and their integration in Agentic Systems collectively enhance factuality, logical consistency, and overall reliability in LLMs [2]. Future research should focus on developing a systematic and layered hallucination mitigation framework that integrates RAG and reasoning enhancement to build LLMs aligned with real-world application demands [2].

In conclusion, the literature demonstrates that RAG plays a significant role in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. By understanding the different types of hallucinations, developing taxonomies, and proposing unified pipelines for attribution-based hallucination mitigation, research continues to progress towards building more reliable and accurate LLMs for real-world applications.
